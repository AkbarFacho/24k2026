                  Algorithm

Problem 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if a Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a
divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
1. Ask user to enter Nth Number
2. Ask user to enter n Number
3. Divide n with Nth
4. If its divisible then print “Divisible “
Else Print “Not divisible”
5. If the answer is odd print “Odd “
Else print “Even “
