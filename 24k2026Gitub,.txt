Problem 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if a Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.


 1.	Ask user to enter Nth Number
 2.	Ask user to enter n Number
 3.	Divide n with Nth 
 4.	If its divisible then print “Divisible “
             Else   Print “Not divisible”
 5.	If the answer is odd print “Odd “
             Else print “Even “





Problem 3:  Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with  all the operators (+, -,*,/,%).


 1.	Ask the User to Input 1st Number
 2.	Ask the User to Input 2nd Number
 3.	If operator is ‘+’
                       1st + 2nd
 4.	If operator is ‘-’
                       1st -  2nd
 5.	If operator is ‘*’
                       1st * 2nd 
 6.	If operator is ‘/’
                       1st / 2nd 
 7.	If operator is ‘%’
                       1st %2nd
